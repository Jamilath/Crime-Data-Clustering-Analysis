Final Clustering Analysis Report
==============================

1. Problem Statement
-------------------
The goal was to perform clustering (K-means and Hierarchical) on the crime dataset to group U.S. states based on crime rates (Murder, Assault, Rape) and urban population (UrbanPop), identify the number of clusters, and draw inferences about crime patterns.

2. Dataset Description
---------------------
The dataset ('crime_data.csv') contains 50 U.S. states with four features:
- Murder: Murder rates per 100,000 people (range: 0.8-17.4).
- Assault: Assault rates per 100,000 people (range: 45-337).
- UrbanPop: Percentage of urban population (range: 32-91).
- Rape: Rape rates per 100,000 people (range: 7.3-46.0).
The data was standardized to ensure fair clustering.

3. Clustering Results
--------------------
Both K-means and Hierarchical clustering (with Ward's method and Euclidean distance) were applied, resulting in 4 clusters. The optimal number of clusters (k=4) was assumed based on prior outputs (elbow plot and dendrogram not described).

3.1 K-means Clustering
----------------------
Number of states per cluster:
- Cluster 0 (Low-crime, rural): 13 states
- Cluster 1 (High-crime, semi-urban): 8 states
- Cluster 2 (High-crime, urban): 12 states
- Cluster 3 (Moderate-crime, urban): 17 states

3.2 Hierarchical Clustering
--------------------------
Number of states per cluster:
- Cluster 0 (Moderate-crime, urban): 19 states
- Cluster 1 (High-crime, urban): 12 states
- Cluster 2 (Low-crime, rural): 12 states
- Cluster 3 (High-crime, semi-urban): 7 states

4. Cluster Characteristics and Inferences
---------------------------------------
4.1 Low-crime, rural states (K-means Cluster 0, Hierarchical Cluster 2):
   - States: Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, Wisconsin
   - Characteristics: Low crime rates (Murder: ~3.1-3.6, Assault: ~76-78.5, Rape: ~11.8-12.2), low urban population (~52).
   - Inference: Safe, rural states with minimal crime, likely due to low population density and simpler socio-economic dynamics.

4.2 High-crime, urban states (K-means Cluster 2, Hierarchical Cluster 1):
   - States: Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Texas
   - Characteristics: High crime rates (Murder: ~11.0, Assault: ~264, Rape: ~33.6), high urban population (~76.5).
   - Inference: Urban, metropolitan areas with significant crime challenges, driven by high population density or urban complexities.

4.3 Moderate-crime, urban states (K-means Cluster 3, Hierarchical Cluster 0):
   - States: Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wyoming (plus Kentucky and Arkansas in Hierarchical)
   - Characteristics: Moderate crime rates (Murder: ~5.9-6.2, Assault: ~141-142, Rape: ~19.2), high urban population (~71-73.6).
   - Inference: Urban states with controlled crime levels, possibly due to effective policing or socio-economic stability.

4.4 High-crime, semi-urban states (K-means Cluster 1, Hierarchical Cluster 3):
   - States: Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee
   - Characteristics: Very high crime rates (Murder: ~13.9-14.7, Assault: ~243-251, Rape: ~21.4-21.7), moderate urban population (~53-54).
   - Inference: Semi-urban states with significant crime issues, possibly driven by socio-economic challenges or regional disparities.

5. Comparison of Clustering Methods
---------------------------------
The Adjusted Rand Index (ARI = 0.8849) indicates strong agreement between K-means and Hierarchical clustering. Key correspondences:
- K-means Cluster 0 <-> Hierarchical Cluster 2 (Low-crime, rural)
- K-means Cluster 1 <-> Hierarchical Cluster 3 (High-crime, semi-urban)
- K-means Cluster 2 <-> Hierarchical Cluster 1 (High-crime, urban)
- K-means Cluster 3 <-> Hierarchical Cluster 0 (Moderate-crime, urban)
Mismatches (2 states):
- Arkansas: K-means Cluster 1 (High-crime, semi-urban) vs. Hierarchical Cluster 0 (Moderate-crime, urban).
- Kentucky: K-means Cluster 0 (Low-crime, rural) vs. Hierarchical Cluster 0 (Moderate-crime, urban).
These mismatches reflect boundary cases due to intermediate crime rates or urban population values.

6. Visualizations
----------------
6.1 Cluster Size Visualization
A bar chart ('cluster_sizes.png') compares the number of states in each cluster:
- Low-crime, rural: 13 (K-means) vs. 12 (Hierarchical)
- High-crime, semi-urban: 8 (K-means) vs. 7 (Hierarchical)
- High-crime, urban: 12 (K-means) vs. 12 (Hierarchical)
- Moderate-crime, urban: 17 (K-means) vs. 19 (Hierarchical)
The chart highlights the larger size of the moderate-crime, urban cluster in Hierarchical clustering due to the inclusion of Arkansas and Kentucky.

6.2 Scatter Plots
Scatter plots visualize cluster separation:
- 'cluster_scatter_plots.png': Murder vs. Assault for K-means and Hierarchical clusters.
- 'urbanpop_rape_scatter.png': UrbanPop vs. Rape for K-means and Hierarchical clusters.
These plots illustrate how clusters differ across key features, with UrbanPop vs. Rape highlighting the role of urbanization in rape rates.

7. Key Findings
--------------
- Crime patterns are strongly tied to urbanization: high-crime clusters are urban or semi-urban, while low-crime clusters are rural.
- The high-crime, semi-urban cluster (e.g., Alabama, Georgia) suggests regional socio-economic challenges, particularly in Southern states.
- The consistency between K-means and Hierarchical clustering (ARI = 0.8849) validates the robustness of the identified patterns.
- Mismatches (Arkansas, Kentucky) highlight states with ambiguous characteristics, warranting further investigation.

8. Limitations and Next Steps
----------------------------
- The optimal number of clusters (k=4) was assumed; elbow plot and dendrogram descriptions could confirm this choice.
- Additional visualizations (e.g., scatter plots of other feature pairs like Murder vs. Rape) could provide deeper insights.
- Further analysis of mismatched states (Arkansas, Kentucky) could explore specific socio-economic or regional factors.
- The dataset is limited to four features; incorporating additional variables (e.g., income, education) could enhance clustering.
